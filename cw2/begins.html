            <br>When Ducard reveals the League's true purpose, Wayne returns to Gotham with the intent of cleaning

          <p>The movie begins with a young Bruce Wayne falling into a well on the Wayne estate.
            His father rappels down to get him after the young boy has been frightened by bats.
            Fast forward 14 years and we see Bruce in prison in Bhutan for theft;
            he was stealing Wayne Enterprises goods.
            He meets Ducard, who bids him to come and train with him in The League of Shadows.
            Bruce gets out of prison and ascends the highest mountain to find The League waiting for him. </p>
            <p>He trains with them and must pass a final test in which he is under the influence of a hallucinogen.
            He passes the test but learns that Ducard wants him to lead a group from The League into Gotham City in
            order to destroy it so they can rebuild it from the ashes
            Bruce then fights all of the trainees and kills a man he thinks is Ra's Al Ghul when the training temple
            is destroyed. Ducard, who is knocked out cold, is saved by Bruce. </p>

          <p>Wayne returns to Gotham City in order to fight the crime and reclaim the city for good and he enlists Lucius Fox,
            a Wayne Enterprises archivist who was also a good friend of Bruce's Dad.
            In order to maintain a facade, Bruce pretends to be a playboy in public so no one will believe that he is the Batman
            at night. Eventually Ra's Al Ghul comes to Gotham
            and Bruce learns that Ducard is Al Ghul and was misdirecting him the entire time he trained him. </p>
            <p>The League of Shadows seeks to contaminate Gotham's water supply with the help of Scarecrow, who is head of Arkham Asylum.
            Scarecrow uses the hallucinogen from the training temple
            in order to manipulate the minds of his patients, and The League is using it to contaminate Gotham's water.
            Batman enlists the help of Detective Jim Gordon, the one trustworthy cop in the Gotham Police Department,
            to help him stop the crime and eventually to stop The League from destroying the city. Batman is able to stop the attack
            and defeat Ra's Al Ghul.
            Batman reveals his identity to Rachel, his longtime best friend and the woman he loves. But she cannot be with him knowing that he is Batman. </p>
